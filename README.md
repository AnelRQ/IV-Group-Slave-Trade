This repository contains our analysis of the study "The Long Term Effects of Africa's Slave Trade."

The data is provided with the "updated" data file containing the interaction terms we created.

This repository includes the code we used to create a more precise analysis of the impact of the slave trade exposure on the current economic outcomes in African countries. 
In order to improve upon this study we utilized the causal forest approach to estimate the causal impact while still incorporating the IV approach.

The instrument used is distance from the trade route, the interaction term is the interaction between the distance between the trade routes and the country's region, and the dependent variable is the GDP which reflects the economic outcome.
